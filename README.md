# Assembly language programs (8086)
These codes answer a microprocessor(sem-5 MU) question bank. All of these codes run on tasm. The numbered files(codes) are assembly language programs for the following questions numbered from 1-30:
WAP - Write a program
1. Write a menu based program to add and subtract two 8-bit numbers.
2. WAP in C to find minimum number from the given numbers using 8086 assembly language.
3. WAP in C to find GCD of two numbers using 8086 assembly language.
4. Write a menu based program in TASM to read, print, count length and print the reverse of the string read.
5. WAP in TASM to find the sum of the given numbers.
6. WAP in TASM to find minimum number from the given numbers.
7. Write a menu based program in TASM to add and subtract two 16-bit numbers.
8. WAP in C to find LCM of two numbers using 8086 assembly language.
9. Write a menu based program in TASM to multiply and divide two 8-bit numbers.
10. Write a menu based program in C to find minimum and maximum of the given numbers using 8086 assembly language.
11. Write a menu based program in TASM to read, print the string and to check if it is palindrome or not.
